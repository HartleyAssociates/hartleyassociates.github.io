      <h2>Cookie Types and Details</h2>

      <p>
        We may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your
        browser or the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's
        hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. Some of the
        cookies we use are essential for the site to operate. The cookies we use are:
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Session cookies</strong> - Session cookies only retain information about your activities during your
        visit to the site. Once you close the browser, the session cookies are lost, and the site will not recognise you
        the next time you return to the site. Session cookies help websites to recognise you and remember the
        information provided by you as you move from one page to another within the same website. If you have to login
        to a website every time you open your browser and visit it - then it is using a session cookie to store your
        login credentials. Many websites use session cookies for essential site functions, and to make sure pages are
        sent to the browser as quickly and efficiently as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Persistent cookies</strong> - Persistent cookies enable websites to remember your preferences and
        settings (i.e., login information, language selection, font size preference, etc) so that they can offer you a
        more personalized and convenient access the next time you visit. For security purposes, your login information
        is generally encrypted by the web server before it gets stored in a cookie. Persistent cookies can exist for an
        extended period of time until expired or until they are deleted. They enable the site to recognise you on a
        continuous basis. This is done by the web server planting a small text file with a unique ID tag on your
        computer. On subsequent visits to the site, your browser delivers this cookie over to the site, allowing the
        site to retrieve the matching file. If you login into a website, then shut down your computer, start it up
        again, and go back to the website to find you are still logged in - then it is using a persistent cookie to
        remember you.
